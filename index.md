# Golhaye Ghali: a dataset for the most beautiful constructions in Farsi and Mazani

## Background
This repository explores profanity constructions in Farsi and Mazani, focusing on idiomatic expressions rather than isolated swear words. While existing resources primarily list individual profanities, this project seeks to document multi-word constructions that convey offensive, humorous, or metaphorical meanings in everyday speech.

## Why This Matters?
Profanity constructions offer a unique window into the compositionality of language—the way words combine to create meanings that go beyond their individual parts. Unlike single-word profanities, which can often be translated directly, idiomatic constructions rely on cultural context, figurative meaning, and syntactic flexibility. This dataset sheds light on:

- Semantic Opacity: The meaning of a construction is often non-compositional, meaning it cannot be derived from the sum of its parts.
- Cultural Encoding: These expressions reflect historical, social, and regional nuances that are often lost in translation.
- Linguistic Productivity: New profanity constructions emerge dynamically, illustrating the creative nature of language use.
