# Golhaye Ghali: a dataset for profanity constructions in Farsi and Mazani

## What is this dataset for?
This repository explores profanity constructions in Farsi and Mazani, focusing on idiomatic expressions rather than isolated swear words. While existing resources primarily list individual profanities, this project seeks to document multi-word constructions that convey offensive, humorous, or metaphorical meanings in everyday speech.

## Why This Matters?
Language is believed to be largely compositional: the meaning of multi-word sequences can be mostly composed and decued from the meaning of each word. For example, the meaning of "a white tower" is a tower that is white, which is a composition of its element, "white" and "tower". Compositionality allows speakers to generate complex meaning from a relatively smaller set of basic units, which is good because speakers don't need to memorize the sentence for every possible meaning; instead, they just need to memorize the meaning of each individual word, along with the rules to compose them together.

However, not everything about language is compositional. A counterexample is *idioms* in English: the sentence "put yourself in other people's shoes" doesn't mean you are actually wearing other people's shoes, as its individual words combined together will suggest. Instead, this sentence means to think in someone else's perspective. Another counterexample is some syntactic structures in English: "I am *into* laiko" does not mean I am physically into laiko music, as, again, its individual words combined together will suggest. Instead, it means I like laiko music.

Profanity constructions, which this dataset offers, is another example: words (usually vulgar) composed together mean something completely different from their individual parts. In English, the examples are "bullshit" vs. "batshit" vs. "horseshit" - they don't refer to the defecation of different animals. 

Why is this the case? How do these seemingly arbitraily meanings get assigned to these collection of words? In this dataset, we hope we can provide future researchers with data points to potentially draw inferences from. We choose Farsi and Mazani because they seem to be understudied languages with rich such constructions. Another theoretical value of this dataset is that it might offer a probe of how languages were spoken a long time ago, since these constructions were thought to have been formed a long time ago and have survived language changes due to their sociological values (cf. Progovac, 2024).
